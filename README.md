# splashkit-FlyCatch
A small game written in C++ using the splashkit library 

## The idea
This was for a task related to my Introduction to Programming unit during University. A "spider" (black circle) would be able to travel around the screen to collect "flies" (green circles) that would spawn in random locations on random intervals.


A demonstration of the C++ FlyCatch game can be found [here](https://youtu.be/To3jWghBymQ)
